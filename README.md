<h1>🚀 React CRUD Application</h1>

A modern and responsive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using React, React Router, Axios, and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates core front-end development concepts, API integration, and state management while following clean UI and component-based architecture.

The application allows users to view a list of posts, create new posts, edit existing ones, and delete posts in real time. It uses a reusable Axios instance to interact with a REST API and provides instant user feedback through toast notifications.

This project is designed as a learning-focused MERN frontend foundation, helping developers understand how real-world React applications communicate with APIs and manage dynamic data.
